Vengeful sheep is a funny server mod, based on sheep really hating your guts.

Sheep can now shear you back! Now, you too have to eat grass. How humiliating!

Operation is simple, no config needed (for now). Simply put the mod jar into your mods folder and fire up the server. Players can be manually "sheared" and "unsheared" with the commands `/shear $PLAYERS` and `/unshear $PLAYERS`, respectively.

### Now the big question
What do you mean shearing?!
Whenever you get sheared, you lose all your skin layers. Don't worry, as you can simply eat grass (haha nerd) to regain your full self. (Or relog, but we don't talk about that)

Best hope you treat your sheep well, or they just might retaliate!
